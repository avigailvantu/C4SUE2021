    "Pandas is one of the most popular packages on Python. Among the most powerful features of pandas is the ability to filter, design, and load relational dataset. The main Pandas’ data structure is DataFrame (DF). Using DF’s you can easily manipulate data in format of rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of Pandas most useful functionalities are dealing with missing data, convert data formats, join and merge multiple tables, and filter and reshape data. We will go through some of these today. I recommend getting the O’Reilly book on Pandas named “Python for Data Analysis”, which was written by Wes McKinney the creator of Pandas. The book's 2nd edition is a good reference to many Pandas commands. https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/ Today’s examples will be partially inspired by this book."
